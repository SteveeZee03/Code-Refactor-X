# Code Refactor Starter Code
During the refactoring of the key code, I added an alt tag for an image source, I added label text and a input prompt one for text and one for email respectively. I also added class selectors in order for html text to link with css. 

During the refactor, the code already came with semantic html. The code came with three background colors, and the page already included more than two heading elements.
